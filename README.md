# KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics-virtual-internship

This is the project I made for the KPMG Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship (https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/theme/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship?ref=NjwpCoeGYmhbYxDwL).

It was about Data Quality, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis and presentation the insights in Microsoft PowerPoint & finally making a informative Dashboard.

At the first task, I had to find data quality issues, such as empty values, duplicates, incorrect data types etc. and then to send an email to the client referring all these problems.

For the second task, I had to make EDA to find insights about the customers and their transactions. Through the analysis I had to make recommendations to the marketing team for the customers that they should target.

For the third and final task I created a dashboard communicating the most useful insights.

The tools I used were Python on Jupyter for the investigation of Data Quality issues as long as for the Data Cleaning & EDA. I also used PowerPoint for a presentation and Tableau for the final dashboard.
